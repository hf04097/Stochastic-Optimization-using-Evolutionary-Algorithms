# Stochastic Optimization using Evolutionary Algorithms

## 1) Evolutionary Algorithms:
Two different,benchmark optimization problems are solved using genetic algorithms. The problems solved are:

* **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)**
* **Knapsack Problem**


The following selection schemes were implemented:
* Fitness Proportional Selection
* Rank based Selection
* Binary Tournament
* Truncation
* Random


## 2) Evolutionary Art
